## Environment Setup
This repository consists of collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python files that will walk you through different applications of data/AI skills in security

The authors have tested this in the following environments
- VS Code 1.98.2 on a MacOS 15.3.2

### MAC Instructions
1. Install uv (uv manages python versions, packages and dependencies)
a. Follow your preferred method of installation [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). We recommend Homebrew installs on Mac
b. Run `uv python list` and note this output. This will be used later. 
c. Add the following to your login shell settings (Ex: ~/.bash_profile on Mac)
```
eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"
export PATH="$PATH:<your output from step 1b>" (It should look something like: export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/path/to/uv/python/cpython-3.10.16-macos-aarch64-none/bin/")
export UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE="only-managed"
```
### Windows Instructions
1. Install uv (uv manages python versions, packages and dependencies)
a. Follow your preferred method of installation [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). 
b. Run `uv python list` and note this output. This will be used later. 
```
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv  -e
\\Setup for autocompletion of uv commands
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force} 
Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& uv generate-shell-completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"
export PATH="$PATH:<your output from step 1b>" 
\\Example: export PATH="$PATH:cpython-3.14.0a6-windows-x86_64-none"
export UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE="only-managed"

```
2. Git clone this repository by running:  `git clone git@github.com:AI-and-Security/ai_for_sec_workshop.git`

3. Inside the repository, run the command to test your execution environment. The output is self-explanatory
`uv run test.py` 

4. In your favorite IDE, navigate to repository/notebooks and click on test.ipynb
- Select your environment for the notebook (This should be the `.venv` folder that is created in repository directory). Refer to your IDE docs/favorite AI assistant to understand how to provide an existing environment for jupyter notebooks. 
- VS Code Example: VS Code will prompt you to select a kernel and provide choices. By default, it should look in the current directory and present .venv as an option
- Execute the first cell to test the environment for notebook execution. The output is self-explanatory

5. Download datasets from the provided Google Drive. Add all the datasets to the data folder
